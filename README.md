Trying to learn... 

Obviously the data is from the web so dont blame me if there already is a use of it somewhere out there on github

<b> Every model is under development </b>

### Models finished:
- Student_grade_prediction

> I will also use this repo as a sort-of TO-DO list. So I'll drop here my code to then-later take care of it. Files labeled: WSI (Uni Class - "Intro to Artificial Inteligence") are those sorts of files :)
